# 🚀 Vendor Dashboard Profile Viewer (by QR Code)

This Flutter project allows users to **scan a QR Code** generated from the main project 👉 [prothes_vendor-dashboard](https://github.com/prothesbarai/prothes_vendor-dashboard)  
and **instantly navigate** to the corresponding vendor’s profile page using a **unique key-based system**. 🔑

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. 📱 **Generate QR Code** → From the main project (`prothes_vendor-dashboard`), each vendor has a unique key.
2. 📷 **Scan QR Code** → This app scans that QR code using the device camera.
3. 🔗 **Navigate to Profile** → Based on the decoded key, it fetches and displays the vendor's profile dynamically.
